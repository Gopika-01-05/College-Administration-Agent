The College Admission Agent is an AI-powered assistant built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that transforms the traditional student admission process into a smart, interactive, and transparent experience.

🔍 Key Features:
RAG-Powered Retrieval: The agent pulls information from trusted institutional sources like official websites, policy documents, course catalogs, and FAQ databases.

Natural Language Understanding: Students can ask questions in simple, everyday language — e.g., “What are the eligibility criteria for B.Tech?” — and get precise, real-time answers.

Comprehensive Guidance:

Course selection based on interests and eligibility

Application process walk-through

Fee structure and scholarship details

Important deadlines and document checklists

Real-Time Accuracy: By connecting to constantly updated databases, the agent ensures up-to-date information, reducing the need for human intervention.

Improved User Experience: The chatbot reduces confusion, eliminates misinformation, and increases accessibility for students and parents alike.

🖥️ Technology Stack Overview
✅ Mandatory Components Used:
1. IBM Cloud Lite Services
Watson Discovery / Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU):

Extracts key data and insights from admission documents, brochures, and web pages.

Supports the RAG pipeline by enabling semantic document search.

IBM Cloud Object Storage:

Stores institutional documents (PDFs, brochures, policies) in a scalable and cost-effective way.

IBM AppID (Optional):

Provides authentication if students need to log in to track personalized information (like application status).

IBM Cloud Functions:

Handles backend logic to integrate document retrieval, search queries, and user questions.

IBM Code Engine / Kubernetes Lite:

Used to deploy the chatbot application and scale as needed.

2. IBM Granite (Generative AI Models)
IBM’s Granite Foundation Models are used for:

Natural language processing and answer generation.

Summarizing retrieved documents dynamically.

Converting complex institutional text into student-friendly responses.

These models support the generation part of the RAG pipeline — enabling fluent, informative responses based on retrieved data.

🧩 How RAG Works in This Solution
Retrieval:

A user’s question is converted into an embedding (vector representation).

The system searches IBM Watson Discovery or a vector database to find relevant documents.

Augmentation:

Retrieved documents (e.g., PDF admissions guides, website content) are appended to the prompt for generation.

Generation:

IBM Granite generates the final response using the context from retrieved data — accurate, explainable, and traceable.
